# GLRTA_HSI_Restoration

This is the demo for work "Geometric Low-Rank Tensor Approximation for Remotely Sensed Hyperspectral And Multispectral Imagery Fusion", co-authored by Na Liu, Wei Li, Rao Tao, Qian Du and Jocelyn Chanussot. This work has been published in IEEE TGRS (DOI: 10.1109/TGRS.2022.3177719).

Notes:
1) The test code for Pavia University destriping, Landsat7 SLC-off inpainting, Gaofen5 spectral restoration and Bay Area cloud completion can be found in folder 01-05, respectively.
2) The Proposed method can be found in The folder "Proposed", where we also provide some basic graph construction methods. We also welcome more advanced graph construction methods.
3) Quality Assessment is provided by Yi Peng.
4) We also provide the code o compute the rank of the images by using HOSVD.
5) Some datasets can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IXwLeBttgCMB56e5of8uD4SSa18zdvmS/view?usp=sharing
6) We also add the codes for deep hyperspectral prior and T3SC in the file for your convenience.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me by sending emails: na.liu.leca@gmail.com or to Prof. Wei Li: liw@bit.edu.cn
We also share the code at open remote sensing: https://openremotesensing.net/.
